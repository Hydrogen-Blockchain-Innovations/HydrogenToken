This roadmap represents some of priorities for us over the next couple months. Issues or pull requests will be opened to discuss each of these items as they progress.

## 1. Project status

- [x] Create a H2I core team with at least 2 GitHub employees and at least 1 community member. The core team is [@geopayme](https://github.com/geopayme)


## 2. Modernize the community

- [ ] Consolidate all officially supported H2I projects into a single GitHub organization. This will include github/HydrogenToken and a handful of supported scripts.

## 3. Modernize the project

Each of these proposals will go through the [H2I Evolution](https://github.com/Hydrogen-Blockchain-Innovations/evolution) process.

- Publish a public script directory backed by NPM
