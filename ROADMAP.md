# Hydrogen Blockchain Innovations Roadmap

This roadmap represents some of priorities for us over the next couple months. Issues or pull requests will be opened to discuss each of these items as they progress.

## 1. Project status

- [x] Create a H2I core team with at least 2 GitHub employees and at least 1 community member. The core team is [@geopayme](https://github.com/geopayme)


## 2. Modernize the community

- [ ] Consolidate all officially supported H2I projects into a single GitHub organization. This will include github/HydrogenToken and a handful of supported scripts.

## 3. Modernize the project

Each of these proposals will go through the [H2I Evolution](https://github.com/Hydrogen-Blockchain-Innovations/evolution) process.

- Publish a public script directory backed by NPM
