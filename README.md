# Introduction
**Hydrogen Innovations Co., (HHI)** is an innovative energy production technology company created by a dedicated team of engineers and scientists with a mission to produce affordable hydrogen as the long-awaited and overall best fuel for electric vehicles and for various forms of electric energy production & storage. H2I’s technology will enable the low-cost production of hydrogen gas from a variety of feedstocks, including clean biogas, bioethanol, and methane natural gas. Our hydrogen electric storage systems can be integrated with existing wind and solar facilities to optimize their electric energy production, providing application-level load management as well as an economically sustainable energy infrastructure. Our technology will provide inexpensive, clean power for zero emission electric vehicles, fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, fuel for conventional fuel cells to produce electricity for buildings & communities and pure hydrogen to supply long established industries and technologies.

The interest in the use of hydrogen as an energy source has expanded over the last few decades, particularly because energy production from hydrogen can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, bolster energy security, and reduce local air pollution. Moreover, the demand for hydrogen as a feedstock in industries such as petroleum refining and ammonia production is continually growing and is consumed on the order of billions of cubic meters per year.

Hydrogen is also increasingly used for fuel cell powered vehicles, material handling equipment (e.g. forklifts) and many other industrial processes. Although use in vehicles is just a fraction of today’s hydrogen market, the production of hydrogen-fueled vehicles is rapidly increasing as an alternative to lithium battery powered vehicles. In this regard, Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are extremely friendly environmentally because they emit only water vapor in their exhaust. In contrast to even fast-charge existing battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can be rapidly refilled, in about the same amount of time as refueling a gasoline powered vehicle. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can be designed to have much longer ranges than battery powered vehicles, eliminating “range-anxiety,” since hydrogen vehicles can easily be fitted with larger tanks to store more light-weight hydrogen. This is in contrast to battery powered vehicles which are limited by how many heavy batteries can be added to the car before encountering diminishing returns on range.

Research and development programs worldwide have increasingly focused on developing and improving technologies for hydrogen production and separation. When hydrogen is produced continuously, either by a thermochemical means or by electrolysis, the product stream often contains many byproducts, such as steam, hydrocarbons, carbonaceous species, or an inert sweep gas. Therefore, an energy-efficient hydrogen separation technique is crucial to large scale hydrogen production.

# Hydrogen Production using Membrane Separation

Hydrogen can be produced and purified by pressure swing adsorption (PSA), cryogenic distillation or membrane separation. Although PSA and cryogenic distillation are currently used for commercial hydrogen production, they are energy intensive techniques. On the other hand, Membrane separation processes that have been developed by HHI and introduced in this information memorandum require far less energy and are capable of operating continuously. In short, hydrogen permeable membranes are considered to be the most promising and innovative technology for inexpensive high-purity hydrogen production. By contrast, PSA and cryogenic distillation also require huge amounts of expensive auxiliary equipment, making them economically viable for large economies-of-scale applications only. Membrane separation is much simpler and can also be scaled down to localized and targeted (de-centralized, also known as “distributed energy”) production; for example, for businesses such as a gas-stations or as back-up power for buildings, industrial parks or housing estates, including stand-alone micro-grid installations. With de- centralized production, the freight costs associated with shipping hydrogen to the end-user would be eliminated.

Hydrogen permeable membranes can be generally classified into four categories based on materials: (i) polymer (organic), (ii) metallic, (iii) carbon and (iv) ceramic. The latter three inorganic membranes can further be divided into porous and dense membranes. HHI has concentrated on metallic membranes, as they demonstrate greater advantages over the other three types of membranes. These advantages include:
- Chemical stability in the presence of most all chemicals.
- Medium temperature operation (~400 C).
- Production of extremely high purity hydrogen.
- The highest permeation rates (hydrogen production rates) versus the other types of
membranes.

# Proposed Roll-out Strategy

Initially, we propose taking our HHI business “door-to-door.” By carefully researching, calling on and personally visiting distribution facilities that use large amounts of hydrogen daily to power hydrogen electric material handling equipment, we intend to offer considerable savings and other advantages to such customers’ needs by directly interfacing with their top management, buyers and plant personnel. Traditional gas suppliers ship hydrogen to these locations at high prices, with the customer having virtually no other options to procure a less expensive source of hydrogen. H2I will offer five-year contracts to these customers, designing, installing and operating hydrogen production systems on-site. We expect to quickly become the customers’ preferred provider of hydrogen, supplying them with reliable, lower priced, on-demand hydrogen. We expect this customer base alone to quickly achieve our financial projections, with other market opportunities providing us a strong hedge to ensure rapid growth in demand for our hydrogen across all sectors of industry.

HHI is aggressively pursuing other hydrogen off-taker opportunities. Since we are not encumbered with a large staff, we have the flexibility to explore markets and niches for our systems on an ad hoc basis, offering tailor-made solutions to fit each customers’ unique and potentially challenging siting requirements using our modular platforms. Our fuel flexible separation technology allows us to optimally blend hydrocarbon resources to produce both inexpensive and reduced carbon impact hydrogen. As an example, we are working with ethanol producers to develop deployment mechanisms to expand their own markets by converting ethanol to higher commodity value hydrogen, increasing the profitability and market reach. By blending pipeline natural gas with renewable ethanol in ratios determined by real time feedstock pricing, we are able to produce wholesale hydrogen at price points well below the current average wholesale hydrogen price of $8/kg. Moreover, we have the opportunity to further reduce our costs by being able take advantage of the oil industry Renewable Identification Number (RIN) Credits as a blender of ethanol with natural gas. These RIN Credits can increase profit margins significantly, and offer profitable carbon reduction advantages as well.

We also intend to develop and market our capability to store hydrogen and to utilize this to make available on-demand electric power via off-the-shelf fuel cell units, producing electricity at well below market prices. Since we do not require the sun or wind to produce power, we are able to fill the void of power deficits by exploiting the opportunities presented by the limitations of those technologies. Integrating HHI’s on-demand power generation capabilities will help level output, making these installations more profitable for both HHI and our customers. The opportunities highlighted above are a fraction of our readily available market, which is why we are so confident about meeting and exceeding our financial projections.
