## Introduction
**H2Integrate Co., Ltd. (H2I)** is an innovative energy production technology company created by a dedicated team of engineers and scientists with a mission to produce affordable hydrogen as the long-awaited and overall best fuel for electric vehicles and for various forms of electric energy production & storage. H2I’s technology will enable the low-cost production of hydrogen gas from a variety of feedstocks, including clean biogas, bioethanol, and methane natural gas. Our hydrogen electric storage systems can be integrated with existing wind and solar facilities to optimize their electric energy production, providing application-level load management as well as an economically sustainable energy infrastructure. Our technology will provide inexpensive, clean power for zero emission electric vehicles, fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, fuel for conventional fuel cells to produce electricity for buildings & communities and pure hydrogen to supply long established industries and technologies.

The interest in the use of hydrogen as an energy source has expanded over the last few decades, particularly because energy production from hydrogen can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, bolster energy security, and reduce local air pollution. Moreover, the demand for hydrogen as a feedstock in industries such as petroleum refining and ammonia production is continually growing and is consumed on the order of billions of cubic meters per year.

Hydrogen is also increasingly used for fuel cell powered vehicles, material handling equipment (e.g. forklifts) and many other industrial processes. Although use in vehicles is just a fraction of today’s hydrogen market, the production of hydrogen-fueled vehicles is rapidly increasing as an alternative to lithium battery powered vehicles. In this regard, Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are extremely friendly environmentally because they emit only water vapor in their exhaust. In contrast to even fast-charge existing battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can be rapidly refilled, in about the same amount of time as refueling a gasoline powered vehicle. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can be designed to have much longer ranges than battery powered vehicles, eliminating “range-anxiety,” since hydrogen vehicles can easily be fitted with larger tanks to store more light-weight hydrogen. This is in contrast to battery powered vehicles which are limited by how many heavy batteries can be added to the car before encountering diminishing returns on range.

Research and development programs worldwide have increasingly focused on developing and improving technologies for hydrogen production and separation. When hydrogen is produced continuously, either by a thermochemical means or by electrolysis, the product stream often contains many byproducts, such as steam, hydrocarbons, carbonaceous species, or an inert sweep gas. Therefore, an energy-efficient hydrogen separation technique is crucial to large scale hydrogen production.
